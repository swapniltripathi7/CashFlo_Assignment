# CashFlo - Assignment - .NET Intern

1. Form1.cs - UI interface to insert Username and Password in SQLite database and Windows Credential Manager
2. Projectinstaller.cs - contains installer with ServiceName = CashFlo_service
3. DB_Link.cs - create link with sql database "DemoDB.db"
4. Comments.cs - contains class Username and Password
5. program.cs - calls window service (Service1.cs)
6. service1.cs - Caling external API to store on Windows credential manager and sqllite database

The code is non-functional. I have to download Nuget Library to store on windows credential manager.

I couldn't implement - Option to view, sort and clear data from SQLite.
